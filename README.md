# Snake

Made by LeC in December, 2020

## 1. Brief Introduction

This is a classic Snake game with following modes:

- Single player mode: try to eat as many fruits as you can.
- Two player mode: avoid making stupid mistakes and try to kill the other player, although you have scores, but the controller only JUDGES THE WINNER BY WHO IS THE SURVIVOR.
- Player vs AI: the AI is currently very foolish, sometimes it will run into itself. So as long as you play carefully, you can win easily.

  
## 2. Basic Functions

- Game start menu.
- Control the movement of the snake by keyboard and display it on the screen.
- Judge and display the bricks and food, show significant difference between them.
- Being able to pause and restart.

## 3. Advanced Functions

- Three game modes (single, AI, Two player)
- Four kinds of special food: 
  1. gain an extra life (when you die with extra lives, your life-- and your score is set to 0, and you are INVINCIBLE for a little while, which aims at providing you some time to react with the change)
  2. speed up for a while
  3. speed down for a while
  4. UNSTOPPABLE for a while (when you become UNSTOPPABLE, you are capable to destroy the bricks. Besides, when your head collides with the other player's body, YOU WIN THE GAME).

## 4. Expecing Funtions

- Save and load file.
- Map editing.
- Rank System.
- Better UI.

## 5. Tips

- Player One can control the snake with WSAD , Player Two with direction keys.
- You CAN pass through the border of the window and appear on the other side, so show your special skills.
- All the special foods' abilities have a TIME LIMIT.
- When you become INVINCIBLE, your snake's colour will change to  gold. When you become UNSTOPPABLE, it gets to be darkred. When these effects are going to fade away, the snake colour will SWITCH TWICE to remind you.
- You can have a unique colour by pressing the keys in a special sequence (haven't accomplish yet).

Due to the deadline, this game may seem a little poor, but this is my first game and I really enjoying writing it (though it makes me crazy when I can't find the bugs). I hope you can enjoy playing it, and I am willing to have your feedback and advice. THANK YOU!
